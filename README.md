<h1 align=center>Material Design for Bootstrap</h1>

Material Design for Bootstrap is the best way to use [Material Design guidelines by Google](https://material.io/design/introduction/)
in your Bootstrap 4 based application.
Since this is a fully customizable version of Bootstrap, just include Material Design for Bootstrap CSS instead of Bootstrap CSS, and include the JavaScript at
the end of your document (just before the `</body>` tag), and everything will be converted to Material Design.
